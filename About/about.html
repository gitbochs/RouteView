		<li>Create a simple route</li>

		<li>Add a new waypoint in the route</li>
		<li>Play a specific segment of the route, or the whole route</li>
		<li>Using a slider, navigate quickly between the route</li>
		<li>Show point of interest</li>
		<li>Change on the fly the step and the interval between each images along the route</li>
		<li>Create a gpx file or a Google Maps url (that you email)</li>

	  By '<i>Playing a route</i>', we means displaying Street View images along the route, using a configurable step and interval. 
	  The default is to play a Street View image at each 150 meters (575 feet), each 3/4 of a second (750 milliseconds).
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  We try to keep the bearing accurate <i>as much as we can</i>, but this is not always possible, depending of the number of curves 
	  within the step interval (150 meters / 575 feet as default).
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  You can create a route with up to 24 waypoints, plus an origin and destination. Waypoints can be created by either:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Right-click on the map (waypoint will be added at the end)</li>
		<li>Enter the address (or town, point of intereste, etc.) in the route description</li>
		<li>Drag the route line directly: point at it, hold down, and then drag. The waypoint will be added within
		    the other waypoints, if any</li>
		<li>Show an image using the pegman (Street View Image)</li>
	  </ul>

<h2>This application <big>requires</big> a Google Maps API Key</h2>

Beginning on June 11, 2018, Google requires to use a valid API key
for all Google Maps projects. Since I can not afford to have my personal
key to be used here by everbody using this free program, your only option is
to request on-line a Google Maps API key and use it here (see configuration panel).
<br>
<br>

Notes:
  <ul>
    <li>Your key is saved locally and not shared anywhere.</li>
    <li>Unless you use this program 24/7, it's very unlikely you will generate enough
    traffic to be billed by Google. I use this program a lot with my own Google Maps
    API key and I am VERY far to be billed.</li>
  </ul>

<b>Without a Google Maps API this program is NOT usable.</b>
<br>

<br>
Since 06/11/2018, in order to get a Google MAPS API key, you need to provide a valid card number (visa, mastercard, etc.). 
Since Google gives a $200 credit, it will be very unlikely you will be billed using Street Vide Player, unless you use it 24/7 ;-)

<br>
<br>
There is a lot of information and chat on the Net regarding the new Google API model.

Oh, before I forget... <br><br>
